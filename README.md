# Overview 

Momentum is a web framework written in Dart programming language and is inspired by frameworks like [Laravel](https://laravel.com), [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org), and [Express Js](https://expressjs.com).

The goal of Momentum web framework is to provide developers effectively build backends in Dart. Currently, Dart is mainly used for developing client-side apps using Flutter. Our idea is to use Dart language for developing server-side applications also.
